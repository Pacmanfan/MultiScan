Image processing used to determine the laser line:

use a spatial - temporal approach

Using 2 successive frames, determine the laser line as such:

f1 is the first color frame with laser line
f2 is the successive color frame with laser line 

convert f1 to greyscale
f1->gf1

convert f2 to greyscale
f2->gf2

Begin by converting the video to grayscale (if a color camera was used),
and evaluate the maximum and minimum brightness observed at each
camera pixel c = (x; y) over the stick-waving / laser line sequence

Imax(x,y) = maxI(x,y,t)
Imin(x,y) = minI(x,y,t)

alg:

Imin is the minimum image
Imax is the maximum image

for(y = 0 ; y < height; y++)
{
	for(x = 0 ; x < width; y++)
	{		
		Imin(x,y) = min(f1(x,y),f2(x,y)
		Imax(x,y) = max(f1(x,y),f2(x,y)
	}
}


To detect the shadow boundaries, choose a per-pixel detection threshold
which is the midpoint of the dynamic range observed in each pixel. With
this threshold, the shadow edge can be localized by the zero crossings of
the difference image

delta_I(x,y,t) = I - I_shadow(x,y)

where the shadow threshold image is defined by:

I_shadow(x,y) = ((Imax(x,y) + Imin(x,y))/2)

In practice, you’ll need to select an occlusion-free image patch for each planar region.
 Afterwards, a set of sub-pixel shadow edge samples (for each row of the patch) are obtained 
 by interpolating the position of the zerocrossings of delta_I(x, y, t)
