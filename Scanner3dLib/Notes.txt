ToDo:
*- Use the opencv "canny" image processing algorithm on the diff image to better determine the features
 - Have multiple ways to calculate the laser plane
	-Top back plane only (25 pix or so)
	-Top back / bottom desk plan
	-left / right sides
*- View option for diff-canny
-diff canny / threshold options
- Open GL viewer
	move / orbit camera
	zoom in / out
	view points
- Automatic camera placement using chessboard
- Automatic desk / backplane placement using chessboard
- Camera calibration and image correction
*- Make the Scanner and the configuration for it global
*	-Library interface to setup / teardown

Post Processing
	-Option to remove back / desk plane points
*	-An X * Y bucket list that is used to group and average points
	 that project to the same 2d screen coordinates
	-Delauney triangulation
	-better export options
